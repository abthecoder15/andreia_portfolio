# Spotify API Authentication Instructions

You need to set up your Spotify API credentials to use this program. Follow these steps:

1. Visit the Spotify Developer Dashboard at https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications.

2. Log in to your Spotify account or create one if you don't have one.

3. Click "Create an App" or similar to create a new Spotify application.

4. Once your application is created, you will find the following information in your application settings:

   - Client ID: Your Spotify API client ID.
   - Client Secret: Your Spotify API client secret.
   - Redirect URI: Specify your application's redirect URI. This should match the URI you've configured for your Spotify app.

5. Replace the placeholders in your program with your actual values:

   - SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID = 'your_client_id_here'
   - SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET = 'your_client_secret_here'
   - SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI = 'your_redirect_uri_here'

Now, your program can authenticate with the Spotify API using these credentials.
